# Sealang Burmese Shortcut

I found [SEAlang Library Burmese](http://sealang.net/burmese) helpful for studying Burmese. Its classic frame UI provides many advanced features and still renders well on computers or large-screen devices. However, on small-screen devices, it is a little bit inconvenient.

This Sealang Shortcut is a simplified 'shortcut' for common queries. For other advanced queries, use the above [website](http://sealang.net/burmese) instead.
